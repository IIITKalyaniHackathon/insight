# Visualizations

This folder contains the Visualizations documentation

Visualizations are elements contained on the InfoWindow. These visualizations show information using
definition list or a variety of charts.

CityDashboard is highly customizable. You can use the responsive charts from Chartist or the powerful D3.
You can also add a complete DOM element using a General Visualization.
