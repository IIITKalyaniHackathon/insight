Powered by GoogleMaps, Chartist and D3, CityDashboard is a great tool to speed up your visualization project.

Aimed to urban based projects, CityDashboard is divided on a map, displaying markers and other location-based elements, and a information window displaying several kinds of visualizations.

## Visualizations

The simplest way to display information is with a Summary Visualization.
